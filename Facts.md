Some facts about BloxLookup:

Total transfered from the server to the client (on first request. also takes into account headers and such) is 23.17 kilobytes. the `main_controller.js` script takes up the most, at 11.18 kilobytes transfered. the smallest is `search_type_stuff.js` at only 1.13 kilobytes transfered

As of the latest release (24/04/2025), the only error in the console is a warning, and that being `Found a sectioned h1 element with no specified font-size or margin properties.` (this excludes the favicon warning)

The "BloxLookup" text in the top right hand corner, when clicked, does nothing, despite showing the `pointer` cursor. This is because i originally planned to have multiple pages, but then decided to just embed everything onto one page, which saves time in making a global style sheet.
